const firstAscensionDescription = `Svaneti is a fabulous and mysterious land of transparent clear lakes, green mountains and hills, ancient castles, legends and traditions. Everything is delightful here, beginning from narrow winding paved streets and ending with museums, churches, cultural monuments and traditions. The destiny of clans, family curses and wars are recorded in local tales and legends that will tell much more about Svaneti than you can read about in books.
Program of excursions “To Svaneti from Batumi” will take you around the most interesting places.
Day 1
The Inguri dam is a unique hydrotechnical structure that is regarded as one of the highest constructions of its kind in the world, located in the mountains. It looks like a prodigious thick wall decorated with stairways, terraces and balconies. It is a favorite destination of tourists who flock here not only to admire its impressive size, but also because it offers magnificent views of surrounding places. Construction of this dam has an interesting history. It sits on the Georgan – Abkhazian border and offers a breath-taking view of the water reservoir and surrounding mountains.
• Walk around Mestia which is regarded as the capital of Svaneti will show you towers with a thousand-year-old history and ancient Christian Orthodox churches which are on the UNESCO list of human heritage.
• Margiani museum is a museum dealing with this area’s ethnography and located in the lands which used to belong to the Margiani family that ranked as the richest and the most inflectional clan here. The museum is very interesting. Among its exhibits one can see objects that Svans used in everyday life, ancient mountaineers gear that is no longer seen today.
• Svan towers are a symbol of mountainous areas of Georgia. Earlier they functioned as dwellings and fortifications to protect the country from frequent enemy attacks. Today they are the main sources of legends. It is possible to climb to the top of such a tower and take a bird’s eye view of the magnificent surroundings.
• Khatsvali is a prominent place of interest in Svaneti and in the whole of Georgia. In winter skiing is popular, while in summer a cable tramway will take you to the top of Khatsvali mountain where you can take another bird’s eye view of the Caucasus mountains. And the higher you rise, the better you can see the changes below: the greenery at the bottom of the mountain is gradually replaced by snow on the top.
• Getting accommodation at the hotel. Night in the hotel in Svaneti.

Day 2
• Ushguli is one of the main places of interest of Svaneti. It features on the UNESCO list of human heritage of the world as a human settlement at the highest altitude in Europe. Also attractive are unique Svan tower dwellings and natural surroundings.

const tushetiDescription = `Tour to Tusheti by jeep cars – a group tour for 3 days / 2 nights

The season for tours opens from the 30th of May. You can join a group at any time at your convenience. A group comprises 5 persons maximum.
If you desire to sense the real magic of high mountains, face Nature on your own, walk on a razor’s edge between Christian and pagan cultures, balance on narrow mountain paths running between steep precipices – then you are to travel straight to Tusheti. It is a marvelous mountain area in the north-east of Georgia that borders on historic regions of Khevsureti, Chechnya and Daghestan and, in truth, is a scarcely accessible region of the Georgian part of the Caucasus. You cannot get there right away, because the road there is open mostly from June to the end of September - beginning of October. There is no regular public transport communication service with those places yet.
To reach your destination there you will need a four-drive off road vehicle – no other cars can get up there. It is not fortuitous that this road, according to the BBC sources, is one of the extremely difficult and dangerous roads of the world. Somehow or other, this area is almost inaccessible and isolated from the rest of the world for approximately seven months every year, while the local people with their herds of cattle and flocks of sheep have to move down to some lower lying areas. These difficulties are particularly attractive to tourists who are eager to challenge hardships like those in Tusheti. 
Tusheti- is a protected area measuring 122050 hectares. About a quarter of it is a landscape reserve, while over 83 hectares belong to the territory of the National Park. However, there are no strict rules that exist in other national parks of Georgia, although you need to be prepared for some local traditions being somewhat queer for a city dweller. For instance, it is strictly forbidden to bring over pork products, so keep it in mind that pork sandwiches are out of the question here. Another tradition is still more rigorous: some holy places, a local church or a pagan sanctuary known here as “nishi” are forbidden for women.
Omalo- is in fact a central village of the region and the first stopover along the trip upward from Kakheti. Some Tushi families even choose to stay here for winter without going down to the valley, which is quite rare for the local people. Noteworthy from historic angle are Keselo towers on a high rock. Within the ensemble there is a small ethnographic museum.
Dartlo- If you start from Omalo, it is a 3 to 4 hours’ walk to reach Dartlo whose houses and towers enjoy the status of historic monuments of culture. Since recently, they have been under restauration financed by the state and international organizations. The village is deserted in winter, though there was one man who wintered there all alone over a few recent years. In other words, Dartlo is inhabited only in summer. Incidentally, Dartlo is the starting point of an impressive 5-day trekking tour to Khevsureti: first the tourists walk 14 trying kilometers to Andak mountain pass and then either walk or ride on horseback through uninhabited mountains toward Shatili.
Shenako- This village may remind a Russian-speaking tourist of the film “Mimino” whose main character Valiko comes from, although some episodes of the film were shot also in Omalo. Both villages are at the same altitude, but are divided by a gorge.
Shenako is the village where there is a Christian Orthodox church Sameba (or Holy Trinity), the only one in this area, built in the 19th century. Its frescoes were renovated at the beginning of our century. Not far from this church there is a “nishi“ or a pagan sanctuary mentioned earlier. Thus, Shenako is a wonderful place where Christianity and paganism are intertwined.
Diklo- There is a road going through Shenako to Diklo that is famous for its fortress. Local people maintain that some time back in the 19th century 16 intrepid warriors bravely defended it for over two weeks against an army of 10000 men who came from the North Caucasus. Some fragments of this fortress have come down to us and can be viewed today.

PROGRAM OF THE DAY
Day 1
Leaving Tbilisi towards Kakheti, we shall proceed along a beautiful gorge of the river Stori. The road goes across the highest mountain pass in the area at an altitude of 2970 metres above sea level and runs further to Tusheti - the most gorgeous area of Georgia. From here majestic views meet the eye. We pass powerful waterfalls and see mountain peaks on the border between Georgia and Russia which, according to scientists, serve as air filtres. We shall also visit the village of Kvemo Omalo where there is a department of tourist administration of the Tushi preserve arranged and equipped according to European standards. Having visited the local museum, we shall go further to the village of Shenako where we shall make a stopover and get accommodated in a family hotel Dzveli Tusheti built in traditional Tushi style. We remind you that the distance from Tbilisi to Shenako is 200 kilometers and takes 6 hours to cover. After a meal we shall have a chance to visit Agaurtash township located at an impressive place that will stay in your memory for a long time. Next, we shall go to the border village Diklo and an old village of Diklos (bichebi). In the evening, we shall have dinner at Dzveli Tusheti hotel.

Fortress and nunnery at Mzovreti
This fortress is one of the most attractive historic monuments in Georgia. Recently it turned into a nunnery. The fortress crowns the top of a rocky hill in Dzama gorge.

Our next stop is Anchiskhati church which used to preserve the famous icon of the Anchiskhati Saviour. Originally dedicated to the Nativity of the Holy Virgin, this church acquired the name of Anchiskhati Church because this icon was transferred to Tbilisi from Tao-Klarjeti in 1675. This is one of the oldest historic buildings in Tbilisi which stands witness to the numerous destructions and downfalls of the city.

We shall also see today St.David’s church, also known as Mamadaviti. It is located on the middle station of the funicular ropeway between the city and Mt.Mtatsminda.

Church of St.George the Victorious was founded by Piros of Breti and became a significant centre of the spiritual life of the region.

Today the church preserves many icons of saints with particles of their relics embedded in the Icons.
St.George monastery at Ulumbo was founded by St.Michael of Ulumbo who went to great lengths to promote Christianity in the mountains of Upper Kartli and Oseti.

const threeGorgesDescription = `Day 1- Ateni gorge – Uplistsikhe – a cave township with a history of three millennia

PROGRAM OF THE DAY

• Uplistsikhe -a cave township
• Ateni Sioni
• The village of Biisi and Biisi waterfall 
• Wine-making.

Uplistsikhe occupies a particular place among places of historic interest of Georgia. Its uniqueness is in the fact that this township that is three thousand millennia old is hewn in solid rock. Most of the time it was an inhabited township, but in the 19th century dwellers abandoned it. Now these caves are on the UNESCO list of human inheritance of the world
Ateni Sioni is a church in the village of Ateni to the south of Gori on the left bank of the river Tana. It was built in the 7th century, a little later than the famous Jvari monastery (about 630), before the Arab invasion. Besides beautiful frescoes, it has a great deal of inscriptions both inside and outside the church. Owing to these inscriptions and their historic significance, Ateni Sioni ranks as an unquestionable leader among all churches in Georgia.
The village of and waterfall of Biisi. – Another kilometer along the gorge and between the road and the river, there are ruins of what used to be a bath house with sulphur water, and if you wish, it is possible to have a dip into it. Some 300 metres to the south beyond Biisi there is a small dale across which there is a pathway leading to the Biisi waterfall which is a destination of many people. The main marker of the beginning of the pathway is a wooden bridge across the river Tana. Then we follow a narrow gorge of the river Tkhinala which is quite attractive. We are to travel strictly along the river without diverting upwards where there is a dirt road leading to the village of Tsereti. There are no ups and downs as we travel past unidentified ruins, until we finally reach waterfall of Biisi. It is not big, but quite nice and with an inviting glade beside it.  

Wine-making. Ateni gorge is the only place in Shida Kartli where good varieties of grapes are cultivated that yield wine brands of excellent quality.
It is some kind of a climatic micro area, because it is hard to say why grapes grow very well here and poorly in neighbouring gorges. The wine-makers say that the peculiarities of the local sand are accounted for his phenomenon. Grapes are grown mainly in the lower northern part of the gorge, near the villages Khidistavi and Ateni. Agricultural land is quite scarce here, and since recently people began to make terraces on the slopes. It was from Ateni gorge that “Mtsvane” brand of wine was delivered to Stalin’s table at his dachas. These Stalin’s grapes are grown on a slope near Ateni castle.

Day 2 – Dzama gorge

PROGRAM OF THE DAY
• Kintsvisi Monastery
• Fortress-monastery Mdzovreti
• Lake Bateti  

Dzama gorge is one of the most peculiar places in Georgia which combines both historic and religious monuments. It is an amazing place where you travel in the past to learn the history of Georgia and see its nature and ecology. Dzama valley is a conglomeration of about 60 historic monuments, old and new churches and monasteries, fortresses, defence towers and wonderful nature. It is located some 130-140 km. from Tbilisi, in Kareli municipality. This gorge is of unparallelled beauty and full of monasteries and churches. You feel immersed in an uplifting spiritual environment and sense the grace. People say: “Here, in every church or monastery, if you whisper a prayer, the Lord God will hear it much sooner than if you pray elsewhere “. When you leave the gorge you become determined that you can make your life better and more agreeable to your soul. Bishop Job calls this place “The republic of monks”. After visiting these holy places you will become full of grace and kindness. There are cases of reunification of broken families, many people have joined Christianity and strengthened their faith. Many have overcome incurable diseases by praying here, because the monasteries and churches here are marked with grace. The priest often says that Dzama gorge is the mainstay of Georgia.
Kintsvisi monastery located in Kareli district, Shida Kartli, is a monastery dedicated to St.Nicholas of Myra, and comprises several churches built at different epochs. The main among them is that of St.Nicholas of Myra, built at the beginning of the 13th century in the reign of Queen Tamar. In other words, it means that this church pertains to the Golden Age of Georgian history and architecture and has to do with the person of the Queen. It differs from monasteries of other periods in that it is tucked away deep in Dzama gorge, far from well-trodden roads. It is known that the monastery was built mainly about the year 1200, although a small church of St.Mary dates from the 10th century. The Church of St.Nicholas – the main temple in the ensemble – was erected in the lifetime of Queen Tamar. There are some frescoes surviving from that period. Very few of such frescoes have come down to us, which accounts for the fame of this monastery. 
Fortress-monastery Mdzovreti also known as Mdzovreti or Dzami fortress is a fortification high up on a mountain towering over the village of Ortubani in Dzami gorge (Kareli district). It used to be an old castle, and after the year 2010 a monastery was erected on its ruins. Now the construction work is over, and the monastery has come into prominence. At present this modern Mdzovreti monastery is located high up on a tall mountain in Dzami gorge. This mountain seems to be inhabited in very early epochs. There are rumours that archaeologists unearthed some traces of human habitation dating back to the 1st century. Further history of this mountain is somewhat obscure. At some moment Dzami fortress was built here, which in the 14th century used to belong to Princes Toreli. In the 14th century the gorge was granted to a man named Zaza Tsitsishvili-Panaskereteli, who chose not to live there but stayed in castle Samtsevisi which he built for himself. Later, supposedly in the early 17th century he moved to Mdzovreti castle near a synonymous town.
Lake Bateti is a small lake tucked away in Dzami fortress overgrown with forest in the south of the Kareli district at an altitude of 1250 or 1300 metres above sea level. Three kilometers of bumpety dirt road full of potholes, ups and downs and you are back on the normal tarmac. People come here to enjoy the cool air suffused with fir aroma and take good pictures of an autumn forest. The lake is located in the gorge of the river Batetistsqali that branches off from Dzama gorge. Bartetistsqali is a small river flowing from neighbouring mountains, feeding the lake and falling into the Dzami river. The lake was formed very long ago when a landslide stopped discharge of the water. Precise elevation of the lake is 1313 metres above sea level.
  
Day 3 - Tedzami gorge
  
PROGRAM OF THE DAY
• Erttsminda monastery
• Ikvi church
• Rkoni
• Queen Tamar bridge
• Artsville Garikula

Here we shall inform you about places of interest that are unknown outside Georgia. They hide from the prying eye of foreign guests who are infrequent here, but that does not diminish the significance of this area. The holy places in Tedzami gorge are objects of what is known as home tourism. A trip there will enrich your knowledge and bring you closer to Georgian culture. It starts from the village of Rkoni, from the bridge across the river Tedzami. Here there is a billboard indicating routes from the village of Rkoni to the monastic ensemble of the same name, Queen Tamar bridge, fortress Kldekari and other places. As soon as you cross the bridge, you will find yourselves at the beginning of a winding and well trodden road to the monastery. Following the gorge of the river Tedzami, you climb a rise, and there will be a marvelous view of Rkoni forest. Going through it, you will approach Rkoni monastery where there are many places that are good for pitching tents and arranging a camping. Our company offers a thrilling tour to Shida Kartli, Tedzami gorge and elsewhere. We are sure that Georgian landscapes will be an unforgettable discovery for those who like trekking. We offer various routes from one region of another, through nature reserves, original villages, and the like. Your best adventure is awaiting you. 
Rkoni monastic ensemble This ensemble is comprised of the church of the Virgin Mary, a chapel, a refectory, a tower, a belfry and the church of St.John the Baptist with a gate to it. Surprisingly, this ensemble took a long time in building: from the 7th century when the church of the Virgin Mary was erected through to the 13th-14th centuries when the belfry came into being. 
Queen Tamar’s bridge was built in the 12th-13th centuries, at the period of an important trade route that passed here. It is regarded as one of the best bridges at that time. Now this bridge has been fully restored and has acquired its original aspect.
Artsville Garikula Which is the most bohemian place in Georgia? You should address this question to the locals in Kaspi district after you leave Tbilisi and pass through Mtskheta. The ordinary narrow village road forks at so many places that one is puzzled which way to go among a plethora of houses with orchards. Making sure that the people living here are friendly and used to being asked questions, you will see a fence covered in psychedelic graffiti and at the end of the way you will arrive at a house with a tower with a weathercock on top of it, and an open gate. This is Garikula – a paradise for Georgan artists. 

Open your eyes wide to take in greyish-blue mountains on the horizon, vineyards on their slopes, a small pool with silent sculptures around it and a great deal of various works of art scattered all over the territory of the Artsville.
Open your ears because here silence is filled with sounds that mean much more than words. It is a true paradise with no admission to strangers.
This, incidentally, is corroborated by an inscription on the ceiling of a landing of the steep wooden staircase.

The pass is on the lower slopes of the range and its highest point is at an elevation of 1620 metres above sea level.
Ujarma fortress. Owing to its location and historic importance, this fortress is one of the most important monuments of Georgian medieval architecture. Beginning from the 3rd century A.D. it was the residence of Georgian kings and their heirs. It came to florescence in the 5th-6th centuries ‘[in the reign of Vakhtang Gorgasali and his son Dachi. During this period a citadel was erected here with high walls, watch and defence towers together with a residence and a church. 
Old and new Shuamta are a Georgian architectural ensemble in the forest of Telavi district, some 7 kilometres from the town of Telavi. The ensemble consists of two parts – Dzveli (old) Shuamta and Akhali (new) Shuamta and its name originates from its location between three mountains that surround it.
Town of Telavi (the birth place of Valiko from the film “Mimino”) Telavi is known from the 1st century A.D. as a significant trade centre on the caravan route from the Middle East to Europe. In the 11th century and from the 17th to the 18th centuries it was the capital of Kakheti.

Day 3

Uplistsikhe-Ateni Sioni-Gori 

PROGRAM OF THE DAY
• Uplistsikhe
• Ateni Sioni
• Gori (House-museum of I.V.Stalin)

Uplistsikhe. It occupies a particular place among places of interest in Georgia. Its uniqueness is I that this cave township with a history of three millennia was abandoned by the dwellers in the 19th century. Now the caves of Uplistsikhe are on the UNESCO list of human heritage.
Ateni Sioni is a church in the village of Ateni located to the south of Gori on the left bank of the river Tana. It was built a little later than the famous Jvari, in the early 7th century (about 630) before the Arab invasion. Inside there are numerous frescoes and inscriptions both inside and outside the temple. Owing to these frescoes and inscriptions that have come down to us from the Golden Age (from about 1080), their number and their historic value, Ateni Sioni ranks as an unquestionable leader among all churches of Georgia. 
House-museum of I.V.Stalin. Most conspicuous in the very heart of the city, among old buildings rises this majestic palace in the original Gothic style. It is the house -museum of I.V.Stalin, built here in the 1950ies.

const holyVirginGraceDescription = `The Orthodox pilgrimage tour Grace of the Holy Virgin lasts 10 days / 9 nights.
This tour opens an opportunity for you to visit the main holy places of Georgia. Unlike any other trip, it will uplift your mood and soul, for you will visit not only Georgia’s monasteries and churches, but will also come to know more about the cities, towns, health resorts and history of the Georgian people whose heroism at times of war succeeded in strengthening belief in Jesus Christ, owing to whicsh the country has preserved its Christianity. It is not fortuitous that Georgia became an appanage of the Holy Virgin where Christianity was spread by the holy Apostles Andrew the First Called and Simon Canaanite.

Destinations the tour of Georgia offers within 10 days:
Tbilisi – Mtskheta – Gareji – Bodbe – Ananuri – Gergeti – Borjomi – Kutaisi – Batumi.

Day 1 – Meeting at the airport of Tbilisi
Transfer to the hotel.
Free Time

Day 2 – Tour of Tbilisi and trip to Mtskheta 
Breakfast at the hotel. 
Walking tour around Tbilisi will begin with the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity – one of the most ancient Christian temples not only in Tbilisi, but in the whole of Georgia. Few people know that one third of the holy objects are preserved here under the surface of the ground where this masterpiece of ecclesiastic architecture stands today. Three of them open to view are the Icon of Georgia’s Aspirations, the Cross St.Nino erected in Mtskheta and David Gareja’s Stone of Grace.
The Metekhi Church of the Nativity of the Holy Virgin is where St.Abo of Tbilisi was martyred in the 8th century. Preserved here are the relics of St.Shushanik, Queen of Rana, who was martyred to death by her own apostate husband. In her lifetime she was blessed with the gift of working miracles. Even today believers come to pray at her burial place here. Let us now cross the river Mtkvari by the Metekhi bridge dedicated to 100000 martyrs.
The Sioni Cathedral is famous only for its unique architectural style, but also for the religious relics preserved in it – the ancient cross of St.Nino, the head of Apostle Thomas, the odoriferous icon of the Apostle Andrew the First Called. The history of the Sioni Cathedral in inseparably intertwined with that of Tbilisi 
 and is a unique historic and cultural monument of this country. The Sioni Cathedral, dedicated to Assumption of the Holy Virgin, is the centre of Orthodoxy.
Next, we shall visit Anchiskhati Church where the famous Anchis Saviour icon was preserved. Originally, the church was dedicated to the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, but in 1675 it was given another name – Anchiskhati Church owing to the transfer of the Anchi icon here from Tao-Klarjeti. This church is the tallest building in Tbilisi. Just imagine how many times it witnessed - destruction and revival of Tbilisi in the course of centuries from ravages of war until it assumed the shape we see it in today.
The church of St.David, also known as Mamadaviti, is another place of interest. It was built on the territory of today’s Pantheon on Mount Mtatsminda, at the middle station of the funicular ropeway. In the 10th century David of Gareja built a small chapel here where from under a cliff three wonder-working brooks are bubbling, known as “David’s tears”. David Gareja was one of the 13 missionary monks spreading Christianity in Georgia, and believers hold this place holy.
Next, we shall go to Mtskheta – the holy town for all Georgians who come here in thousands to pray at the most venerated Svetitskhoveli Cathedral where the greatest holy relics of the Georgian Orthodox Church – our Lord’s tunic or Hiton and Prophet Elija’s sheepskin cloak are preserved out of sight.
This is not the end of our pilgrimage tour yet. We shall further visit the Samtavro nunnery where the first Christian Georgian sovereigns King Mirian III and his Queen Nana are buried. Here there is also the grave of St.Gabriel, a venerable old man canonized by the Georgian Church. One can touch it, because the holy man had the gift of a prophet and healing power. Many pilgrims from various countries visited him every day, just as they do today. Then we shall visit Jvari monastery where St.Nino, coequal with the apostles, exalted a cross.

Return to the hotel. Night in Tbilisi.

Day 3 – Tour to David Gareja, Signakhi and Bodbe
Breakfast at the hotel.
Visit to one of the most venerated monastic architectural ensembles founded in the 6th century by St.David Gareja. Then we shall move on to Signakhi - a lovely town from the fairy tale nestling in the Alazani valley and surrounded by the Caucasus mountains. Hundreds of pilgrims come here to kneel and pray at the grave of St.Nino.
David Gareji is a monastic architectural ensemble of 20 monasteries and nunneries with St.David’s Church ranking as a lavra or the main one. The ensemble seems to be charged with some sort of energy one feels all over the place. This ensemble has sustained ravages of time and wars and plays a significant role in the spiritual development of Georgia.
Bodbe monastery- a Christian Orthodox monastery where St.Nino is buried. This monastery is proudly considered as one of the first religious sites of ancient Georgia. Preserved here is an Iberian icon of the Holy Virgin that was damaged by a vandal with a surgical scalpel in the Soviet period. Georgian kings used to protect and support this monastery which was a considerable hub of education of the people. 
St.Nino’s spring -is where the believers genuflect before going down to the miraculous spring of St.Nino’s healing water.

Return to Tbilisi. Night at the hotel.

Day 4 – Tour along the Georgian Military Road

Breakfast at the hotel.
Ananuri castle was the main stronghold of belligerent Georgian eristavis or feudatory princes. Within its walls two churches have survived from the 17th century. Historically interesting is the Church of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin, because from the 17th century on, the Turks vigorously spread Islam and destroyed all monuments of Christianity. The other interesting church in Ananuri is the Church of the Holy Virgin, also known as the Church of Salvation, built in 1674 by orders from Anna-hanym Abashidze in memory of her husband and son.
There is no knowledge who these two men were, but it was closed to visitors in 2018.
The Zhinvali water reservoir is rightly regarded as one of the most beautiful spots in Georgia. Besides religious centres, we shall take a trip along the Georgian military road with beautiful views. We shall also see the arch of friendship between the peoples of Russia and Georgia and the Daryal gorge.
Church of the Holy Trinity, built in the 14th century, stands at an elevation of 2170 metres above sea level. It is one of the most interesting holy places of Georgia. The church was often closed at the times of enemy inroads. Being located far away from trodden roads, it was chosen as a place where holy objects of Georgia were brought to be hidden. Nevertheless, despite the fact that the church was difficult to reach, it was guarded by men from the nearby Khevsurian villages who were exempt from drafting into the army at times of war. There is Bethlehem monastery that is still higher, but it is closed to visitors. Nevertheless, there are interesting stories connected with this monasterys which for a long time were regarded as confabulation.

Return to the hotel. Night at the hotel in Tbilisi.

Day 5 – Visiting Phocas nunnery, cave town Vardzia and Rabat
Breakfast at the hotel. 
Today we leave Tbilisi and travel westwards to see the most beautiful Christian places of worship in Georgia. Our pilgrimage will start from lake Paravani, the largest in Georgia. Despite the fact that this lake is located high up in the mountains, its maximum depth is only 3 metres. This pearl of Georgia is surrounded by alpine meadows.
Phocas nunnery is the first place where St.Nino took a rest on her way from Armenia to Georgia. It was here that she met shepherds who showed her the way to Mtskheta. This nunnery functions today and is famous for its cheese and chocolate made by the nuns.
Vardzia is a cave township regarded as one of the most remarkable places of interest in Georgia. One can’t help admiring the scale of this wonder and the skill of the workers who hewed it in the rock. 
It was a township hidden from view which used to give shelter to monks and the local people until an earthquake hit it and ruined some structures. Besides cells and passages within the rock, it is the church of Assumption of the Holy Virgin hewn in solid rock that is admired as a pinnacle of ecclesiastic art.
Rabat fortress is an old stone fortification which is a cultural part of the city of Akhaltsikhe. It is a town within a town with towers, churches, cells and a mosque that have come down to us.

Night at a guest house in Akhaltsikhe.

Day 6 – Timotisubani Monastery and Katskhi Pillar

Breakfast at the hotel. Today we shall move towards Kutaisi. Our first stop will be at Chitakhevi monastery dedicated to St.George which is commonly known here as the Green Monastery. Then we move over to Timotisubani church and its monastic ensemble of Assumption of the Holy Virgin dating from the 12th-13th centuries. 
The Timotisubani church of Assumption of the Holy Virgin is a prominent monument in the cultural heritage of Georgia.
Katskhi pillar –or the monastery dedicated to the Ascension of Our Savior, is located far from tourist routes. This monastery is the destination of numerous pilgrims. Built between the 6th and 8th centuries, it rises some 40 metres above the ground level. Only men are allowed to go up to the monastery with permission from monk Maxim. There is no admittance for women.

Return to the hotel. Night in Kutaisi.

Breakfast at the hotel. General tour of Kutaisi.
Gelati monastery of the Holy Virgin is one of the main monastic ensembles in Imereti, erected by King David the Builder.
Bagrati Cathedral or simply Bagrat in the parlance of the local people, is a favorite place of relaxation for the local people, no matter how many other names refer to it. 
Motsameta monastery overgrown with forest is located at the beginning of a canyon and ranks as the most beautiful monastery in Imereti. Preserved in it are relics of Sts.David and Constantine. They were brothers and were executed because they refused to convert to Islam.

Travelling to Batumi. Accommodation at hotel.

Day 8 – Tour of Batumi. 

Breakfast at the hotel. 
Walking tour around Batumi to see places of worship.
Cathedral of Nativity of the Holy Virgin is the main cathedral in Batumi built in the Roman catholic style. The peculiar architecture of the cathedral attracts not only religious pilgrims, but also tourists who like to see peculiar places of interest and buildings of unusual design.
The Church of St.Nicholas and Piazza are located in the very heart of the historic part of Batumi. The cathedral was built on the funds contributed by the local population and with permission from the Turkish sultan. The gold domes of the church add to the beauty of the city and make Christians happy. Opposite to the church is Piazza. Architecturally speaking, it is an interesting square where you can have a cup of delicious coffee and take nice pictures. Piazza is often described as a little Italy with numerous paintings and mosaics. It often serves as a centre for various functions, official receptions and concerts.
Church of St.Barbara is not so popular as other churches of Batumi, although its history is very interesting. It was built on personal orders of the Emperor Alexander III as part of a military hospital. In the middle of the last century it was closed, and only Stalin had it opened and returned to Batumi in 1946. It is a nice and quiet place with almost no visitors, and the atmosphere here is relaxing and restful.

Details of the tour:
The Dadiani palace is an exquisite family seat of the Megrelian princes Dadiani. It is a true embellishment of the city that testifies to its erstwhile significance. The Dadianis are an aristocratic family and, inter alia, are known for their relationship with Napoleon Bonaparte. One of the princesses of the Dadiani clan was married to Napoleon’s nephew Achille Murat, whereupon many of Napoleon’s personal effects and pieces of furniture and one of the emperor’s death masks devolved upon the Dadianis (two other masks are in England and France). All this used to be preserved in the family museum of the Dadianis. Among other things there also is the shroud of the Holy Virgin. Legend has it that that this shroud was brought over to Georgia from Byzantium by one of the ancestors of the Dadiani princes in the 15th century. This shroud can be seen only on great church festivals.
The estate of the Princes Dadiani is also known for its marvelous garden founded by Princess Dadiani, nee Chavchavadze, sister of Nino Chavchavadze, widow of the Russian author Alexander Griboyedov. In the middle of the 19th century Princess Ekaterina invited famous horticulturists and purchased rare plants from Europe and that is how the garden came into being. Today it is the Zugdidi botanical gardens covering an area of 26.4 hectares. Some trees here are about 200 years old and are regarded as the only specimens on the European continent.
Anaklia is the newest resort on the Black sea in Georgia. Founded only in 2011, today Anaklia resort attracts thousands of tourists and young people from all parts of the world. Despite being located rather close to Kobuleti and Batumi, the climate in Anaklia essentially differs from that in other Black sea resorts. It is subtropical, but drier and with a lesser amount of precipitation. The mean summer temperature is 23 to 25 degrees Centigrade. Owing to perpetual breeze, it is never stuffy here, because the heat is blown off in the daytime and nights are nice and fresh.
Unlike in Kobuleti and Batumi, the beaches here are pure sand, with deck chairs, large umbrellas and shower stands. The beach here stretches for 8 kilometers along the water’s edge. The sea is clear here thanks to a long distance from big cities, and not deep, which is an excellent condition for children to swim.

Day 5 – Ateni gorge – Uplistsikhe – cave township with a history of three thousand years

Gorge of the Tana river in the south of the Gori district that begins from the summits of Trialeti mountain range and ends at the city of Gori where the Tana discharges into the river Mtkvari. The gorge is some 30-35 kilometers long, densely populated and has a road running all the way along the bottom of it. It is famous for Ateni Sioni church and a special climatic micro-zone that allows the people to grow varieties of grapes good for wine making.

Uplistsikhe - occupies a particular place among places of interest in Georgia. Its unique feature is a cave township hewed in rock. Surprisingly, in the course of its 3000-year-long history, people lived here and abandoned it only in the 19th century. Now the caves of Uplistsikhe are under protection of the UNESCO.

Sioni at Ateni- is a church in the village of Ateni located to the south of Gori on the left bank of the river Tana. It was built a little later than the famous Jvari, in the early 7th century (about 630), before the Arab invasion. Inside there are numerous frescoes from the Golden Age (i.e. from about 1080). Besides the frescoes, the church has a great deal of inscriptions both inside and outside whose historic significance makes it a doubtless leader among church buildings in Georgia.
The village of Biisi and its waterfall. Another kilometer along the gorge brings us to the beginning of the village of Biisi, where between the road and the river, there are ruins of what used to be a bath-house with sulphur water. There is abomination of desolation here, but if there is a wish, it is possible to have a dip in genuine sulphur suffused water. Some 300 metres beyond the village down south there is a path leading to Biisi waterfall which attracts many visitors. The path begins with a wooden bridge across the Tana. Then comes a narrow gorge of the river Tkhinala. One is to follow this gorge which is quite attractive. Above, to the right there is a dirt road leading to the village of Tsereti. The path runs along without rises and falls past unidentified ruins and brings us to the waterfall. It is small, but has a nice-looking glade nearby.
Wine-making. Ateni gorge is the only place in the whole of Shida Kartli where excellent varieties of grapes that make fine wine brands are grown. It is a sort of climatic micro zone and it is difficult to say why grapes here are better than those growing in neighbouring gorges. Wine-makers say that specific properties of local sand account for it. Grapes are mainly grown in the lower part of the gorge near the villages of Khidistavi and Ateni. Agricultural land is scarce here, therefore over the recent years the people began to create terraces on mountain slopes. It was the Ateni Mtsvane brand of wine that was delivered to Stalin’s table, and “Stalin’s” variety of grapes was grown on a slope near Ateni castle.

1. Uplistsikhe – a cave township

const firstAscensionDescription_ru = `Сванетия – это сказочный и загадочный край прозрачных чистых озер, зеленых гор и холмов, древних замков, легенд и традиций. Здесь восхитительно все, начиная от узких извилистых мощеных улочек и заканчивая музеями, церквями, памятниками культуры и традициями. Судьбы кланов, семейные проклятия и войны записаны в местных сказках и легендах, которые расскажут о Сванетии гораздо больше, чем можно прочитать в книгах.
Программа экскурсий «В Сванетию из Батуми» проведет вас по самым интересным местам.

День 1
Ингурская ГЭС – уникальное гидротехническое сооружение, которое считается одним из самых высоких в мире, расположенное в горах. Она выглядит как огромная толстая стена, украшенная лестницами, террасами и балконами. Это излюбленное место туристов, которые стекаются сюда не только полюбоваться ее внушительными размерами, но и потому, что отсюда открываются великолепные виды на окрестности. Строительство этой плотины имеет интересную историю. Она находится на грузино-абхазской границе и предлагает захватывающий вид на водохранилище и окружающие горы.
• Прогулка по Местии, которая считается столицей Сванетии, покажет вам башни с тысячелетней историей и древние христианские православные церкви, входящие в список всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО.
• Музей Маргиани – это музей, посвященный этнографии этого региона, расположенный на землях, которые когда-то принадлежали семье Маргиани, считавшейся самым богатым и влиятельным кланом здесь. Музей очень интересен. Среди его экспонатов можно увидеть предметы, которые сваны использовали в повседневной жизни, древнее снаряжение горцев, которое сегодня уже не встречается.
• Сванские башни – символ горных районов Грузии. Раньше они служили жилищами и укреплениями для защиты страны от частых вражеских нападений. Сегодня они являются главными источниками легенд. Можно подняться на вершину такой башни и с высоты птичьего полета полюбоваться великолепными окрестностями.
• Хацвали – выдающаяся достопримечательность Сванетии и всей Грузии. Зимой здесь популярно катание на лыжах, а летом канатная дорога доставит вас на вершину горы Хацвали, откуда вы сможете еще раз с высоты птичьего полета полюбоваться Кавказскими горами. И чем выше вы поднимаетесь, тем лучше видны изменения внизу: зелень у подножия горы постепенно сменяется снегом на вершине.
• Размещение в отеле. Ночь в отеле в Сванетии.

День 2
• Ушгули – одно из главных достопримечательностей Сванетии. Оно включено в список всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО как самое высокогорное поселение в Европе. Также привлекательны уникальные сванские башни-жилища и природные ландшафты.
• Монастырь Ламария окружен каменной стеной. Он выглядит как замок, но на самом деле это монастырь XII века. Внутри него находится церковь Святой Девы, которую мы также посетим.
• Ледник Чалаади – самый легкодоступный, и прогулка к нему сама по себе является развлечением. Пешеходная дорога к леднику доступна не только опытным туристам, но и семьям, и неопытным группам.

Ночь в отеле в Сванетии.

const tushetiDescription_ru = `Тур в Тушети на джипах – групповой тур на 3 дня / 2 ночи

Сезон туров открывается с 30 мая. Вы можете присоединиться к группе в любое удобное для вас время. Группа состоит максимум из 5 человек.

Если вы хотите ощутить настоящую магию высоких гор, встретиться с природой один на один, пройти по лезвию бритвы между христианской и языческой культурами, балансировать на узких горных тропах, пролегающих между крутыми обрывами – тогда вам нужно отправиться прямо в Тушети. Это удивительный горный район на северо-востоке Грузии, граничащий с историческими областями Хевсурети, Чечни и Дагестана, и, по сути, труднодоступный регион грузинской части Кавказа. Вы не сможете добраться туда сразу, потому что дорога туда открыта в основном с июня до конца сентября – начала октября. Регулярного общественного транспортного сообщения с этими местами пока нет.

Чтобы добраться до места назначения, вам понадобится полноприводный внедорожник – никакие другие машины туда не поднимутся. Неслучайно эта дорога, по данным BBC, является одной из самых сложных и опасных дорог в мире. Так или иначе, этот район почти недоступен и изолирован от остального мира примерно семь месяцев в году, в то время как местные жители со своими стадами крупного рогатого скота и отарами овец вынуждены спускаться в низины. Эти трудности особенно привлекательны для туристов, которые жаждут испытать такие лишения, как в Тушети.

Тушети – это охраняемая территория площадью 122050 гектаров. Около четверти ее занимает ландшафтный заповедник, а более 83 гектаров относятся к территории Национального парка. Однако здесь нет строгих правил, существующих в других национальных парках Грузии, хотя вам нужно быть готовыми к некоторым местным традициям, которые могут показаться странными для городского жителя. Например, строго запрещено привозить свиные продукты, поэтому имейте в виду, что свиные бутерброды здесь исключены. Еще одна традиция еще более строга: некоторые святые места, местная церковь или языческое святилище, известное здесь как «ниши», запрещены для женщин.

Омало – это, по сути, центральное село региона и первая остановка на пути вверх из Кахети. Некоторые тушинские семьи даже предпочитают оставаться здесь на зиму, не спускаясь в долину, что довольно редко для местных жителей. С исторической точки зрения примечательны башни Кесело на высокой скале. Внутри ансамбля находится небольшой этнографический музей.

Дартло – Если вы отправитесь из Омало, то до Дартло, чьи дома и башни имеют статус исторических памятников культуры, идти 3-4 часа. С недавних пор они находятся на реставрации, финансируемой государством и международными организациями. Зимой деревня пустует, хотя один человек зимовал там в полном одиночестве в течение нескольких последних лет. Другими словами, Дартло обитаем только летом. Кстати, Дартло является отправной точкой впечатляющего 5-дневного пешего похода в Хевсурети: сначала туристы проходят 14 трудных километров до горного перевала Андак, а затем либо пешком, либо верхом на лошадях через необитаемые горы направляются к Шатили.

Шенако – Эта деревня может напомнить русскоязычному туристу фильм «Мимино», главный герой которого Валико родом отсюда, хотя некоторые эпизоды фильма снимались и в Омало. Обе деревни находятся на одной высоте, но разделены ущельем. Шенако – это деревня, где находится христианская православная церковь Самеба (или Святой Троицы), единственная в этом районе, построенная в 19 веке. Ее фрески были отреставрированы в начале нашего века. Недалеко от этой церкви находится «ниши» или языческое святилище, упомянутое ранее. Таким образом, Шенако – это прекрасное место, где христианство и язычество переплетаются.

Дикло – Через Шенако в Дикло ведет дорога, которая славится своей крепостью. Местные жители утверждают, что когда-то в 19 веке 16 бесстрашных воинов храбро обороняли ее более двух недель от армии в 10000 человек, пришедшей с Северного Кавказа. Некоторые фрагменты этой крепости дошли до нас и могут быть осмотрены сегодня.

ПРОГРАММА ДНЯ
День 1
Выехав из Тбилиси в сторону Кахети, мы проедем по красивому ущелью реки Стори. Дорога проходит через самый высокий горный перевал в этом районе на высоте 2970 метров над уровнем моря и ведет дальше в Тушети – самый живописный район Грузии. Отсюда открываются величественные виды. Мы проедем мимо мощных водопадов и увидим горные вершины на границе между Грузией и Россией, которые, по мнению ученых, служат воздушными фильтрами. Мы также посетим деревню Квемо Омало, где находится отдел туристической администрации Тушинского заповедника, обустроенный и оборудованный по европейским стандартам. Посетив местный музей, мы отправимся дальше в деревню Шенако, где сделаем остановку и разместимся в семейном отеле «Дзвели Тушети», построенном в традиционном тушинском стиле. Напоминаем, что расстояние от Тбилиси до Шенако составляет 200 километров и занимает 6 часов. После еды у нас будет возможность посетить поселок Агаурташ, расположенный в впечатляющем месте, которое надолго останется в вашей памяти. Далее мы отправимся в приграничную деревню Дикло и старую деревню Диклос (бичеби). Вечером мы поужинаем в отеле «Дзвели Тушети».

const holyGorgeDescription_ru = `село Ортубани.
Крепость и женский монастырь в Мзоврети
Эта крепость является одним из самых привлекательных исторических памятников в Грузии. Недавно она была преобразована в женский монастырь. Крепость венчает вершину скалистого холма в ущелье Дзама. Мзоврети когда-то был городом в Нижней Картли, расположенным на реке Дзама, притоке Мтквари. Его основание приписывается царю Мирдату в 113 году н.э. Это было очень популярное место, но в середине 7-го века оно было разрушено Мурваном Абдул Казимом. Это место упоминается в истории в связи с одним из набегов Тамерлана на Грузию. Грузинский царь Георгий VII возглавлял оборону этой крепости от его войск. В 18 веке стены Мзоврети защищали монастырь от многочисленных атак турок и лезгин.
Монастырь Саркинети
Этот монастырь, действующий в атмосфере древних духовных традиций, является жемчужиной Шида Картли. Он посвящен святому Шио Мгвимели и приглашает посетителей увидеть этот монастырь, высеченный в скале в ущелье Дзама. Монастырь является уникальным свидетелем духовного наследия Грузии. Работы по высечению начались в 2008 году, а в 2011 году они были завершены и монастырь был освящен. Это первый монастырь такого рода с 14-го века. Доступ в эту святыню осуществляется через 5-метровый туннель, прорубленный в скале.

const vintagesDescription_ru = `Гомборский перевал. Этот перевал известен своим красивым пейзажем. Это 65-километровая асфальтированная дорога через лесистый Гомборский хребет. Этот хребет является водоразделом между долинами рек Алазани и Иори, а перевал находится на нижнем склоне хребта, его наивысшая точка составляет 1620 м над уровнем моря.

Крепость Уджарма.
Благодаря своему расположению и исторической важности, Уджарма является значительным памятником средневековой архитектуры Грузии. Начиная с 3-го века н.э. эта крепость была резиденцией грузинских царей и их наследников. Она достигла расцвета в 5-6 веках во время правления царя Вахтанга Горгасали и его сына Дачи, когда была возведена цитадель с высокими стенами, сторожевыми и боевыми башнями вокруг церкви и жилых зданий.

Старая и Новая церкви Шуамта
Шуамта — это грузинский монастырский архитектурный ансамбль в лесах Телавского района, примерно в 7 км от Телави. Он состоит из двух частей: Дзвели (Старая) Шуамта и Ахали (Новая) Шуамта. Его название происходит от расположения монастыря в долине, окруженной горами с трех сторон.

Город Телави (откуда родом Валико, главный герой фильма «Мимино»)
Телави известен с 1-го века н.э. как важный торговый центр на караванных путях с Ближнего Востока в Европу. В 9-м и с 17-го по 18-й века он был столицей Кахетинского царства.

const saintsDescription_ru = `Места для посещения: Тбилиси – Мцхета – Гори – Мухрани – Хашури – Гареджи – Кахети – Тбилиси

Этот тур «По стопам 13 святых» проведет вас по монастырям, основанным святыми ассирийскими отцами. Христиане среди вас получат возможность помолиться у их чудотворных икон. В рамках этого паломничества вы посетите уникальный монастырь, где литургия совершается на арамейском языке - языке Иисуса Христа.
Стоимость наших паломнических туров может быть изменена оператором, который может либо сократить количество поездок, либо добавить новые в программу. Если вы желаете посетить святые места Грузии, пожалуйста, присоединяйтесь к одному из наших паломнических туров.

День 1 – Встреча в аэропорту
Встреча в аэропорту Тбилиси
Трансфер в отель. Заселение.

День 2 – Паломнический тур по Тбилиси и его окрестностям
Завтрак в отеле. Пешеходная экскурсия по Тбилиси, начиная с Собора Святой Троицы, который является крупнейшим христианским храмом не только в Тбилиси, но и во всей Грузии. Немногие знают, что треть собора находится под землей, где хранятся самые важные святыни. Этот Собор является настоящим шедевром христианской церковной архитектуры, хранящим три самых значимых объекта поклонения – Икону Надежды Грузии, крест, который святая Нино воздвигла в Мцхете, и Камень Благодати святого Давида Гареджийского.

Посещение церкви Метехи Пресвятой Богородицы, где в 8-м веке был замучен святой Або Тбилисский и где хранятся мощи святой Шушаник, царицы Рани, замученной своим мужем-отступником. Еще при жизни она была благословлена даром чудотворения, а после смерти ей была дана благодать исполнять желания тех, кто приходит к ее могиле с молитвами. Чтобы добраться до этой церкви, мы перейдем реку Мтквари по Метехскому мосту 100 000 мучеников.
Сионский собор известен не только своим уникальным архитектурным стилем, но и хранящимися в нем религиозными реликвиями. Среди них древний крест святой Нино, глава апостола Фомы и благоухающая икона апостола Андрея Первозванного. История Сионского собора неразрывно связана с историей города Тбилиси и является уникальным памятником истории этой страны. Этот собор посвящен Успению Пресвятой Богородицы и как таковой является оплотом православной веры грузинского народа.

Наша следующая остановка - церковь Анчисхати, где раньше хранилась знаменитая икона Анчисхатского Спасителя. Первоначально посвященная Рождеству Пресвятой Богородицы, эта церковь получила название Анчисхатской, потому что эта икона была перенесена в Тбилиси из Тао-Кларджети в 1675 году. Это одно из старейших исторических зданий в Тбилиси, которое является свидетелем многочисленных разрушений и падений города.

Мы также увидим сегодня церковь святого Давида, также известную как Мамадавити. Она расположена на средней станции фуникулера между городом и горой Мтацминда. В 10-м веке святой Давид Гареджийский построил здесь небольшую часовню, где из-под скалы текли три чудотворных источника целебной воды. Верующие называют их «слезами святого Давида» и приходят сюда молиться.

Возвращение в Тбилиси. Ночь в отеле.

День 3 – Экскурсия в Мцхету
Завтрак в отеле. Сегодня мы посетим город-музей под открытым небом, где каждый религиозно значимый объект привлекает тысячи паломников. Каждый из этих объектов дорог грузинскому народу, особенно тем, кто любит историю, религию и архитектуру. Мы начнем нашу экскурсию с посещения монастыря Джвари.
Основанный в 7-м веке, монастырь Джвари первым в Грузии включен в список всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО. Это духовное сердце Грузии. Монастырь поражает зрителя своим уникальным видом и величием.
Собор Светицховели расположен в центре Мцхеты. Это первая и самая почитаемая церковь в Грузии.
Женский монастырь Самтавро - старейший в своем роде в Грузии. Его история связана со святой Нино и начинается с 4-го века. В современной церковной истории это место связано с личностью святого Гавриила. В монастырской церкви хранятся такие христианские реликвии, как Иверская икона Божьей Матери, гробницы царя Мириана и его царицы Наны, а также мощи святого Шио Мгвимели и святого отца Гавриила.

День 4 - Тур по монастырям, основанным ассирийскими отцами
Шио-Мгвиме - первое монашеское братство, основанное здесь в 6-м веке святым Шио, который является самым почитаемым святым в грузинской церкви, отшельником и основателем монашеского движения в Грузии. Монастырь находится под личной защитой Католикоса-Патриарха всея Грузии. Царь Давид IV Строитель даровал этому монастырю статус царского владения.
Монастырь Канда - уникальный монастырь, основанный одним из 13 ассирийских отцов, где богослужение ведется на арамейском языке – языке Господа нашего Иисуса Христа. В настоящее время игуменом этой церкви является схиархимандрит Серафим Бит-Хариби, ассириец по происхождению, чьими усилиями церковь была восстановлена. Этот монастырь стал настоящей Меккой для ассирийцев и принимает много паломников из-за рубежа.
Цикланский собор и деревня Цилкани являются одними из центров зарождения и распространения христианства в Грузии. Этот собор является местом захоронения сирийского отца Исе, который проповедовал здесь христианство. Строительство раннехристианской церкви здесь во 2-3 веках приписывается Бакару, сыну царя Мириана, первого христианского монарха Грузии.
Возвращение в отель. Ночь в отеле в Тбилиси.

День 5. Тур по монастырям, основанным ассирийскими отцами
Завтрак в отеле. Сегодня мы отправимся в Шида Картли - один из наименее известных регионов Грузии, где расположены следующие достопримечательности:
Собор Самтависи - образец грузинской средневековой архитектуры. В середине 6-го века один из сирийских отцов Исидор Самтависский основал одноименную епархию. Первая церковь была построена здесь еще в 5-м веке при царе Вахтанге Горгасали. Собор, дошедший до нас, был построен на фундаменте старого в 1030 году.
Церковь Стефана Первомученика была построена на горе Цлеви недалеко от города Каспи. Сегодня это место известно как монастырь Тетрахеви, церковь которого в настоящее время заброшена и лежит в руинах. Легенда гласит, что святой Фаддей – «воплощение чистой истины и веры» – похоронен в пещере у основания церкви, но точное место его могилы остается неизвестным.
Церковь святого Георгия Победоносца была основана Пиросом из Брети и стала значительным центром духовной жизни региона. Об этом свидетельствует тот факт, что в ее стенах были созданы Бретский военный крест с надписями на нем и переплетенная в кожу рукописная копия Евангелия. Сегодня в церкви хранится много икон святых с частицами их мощей, вложенными в иконы.
Монастырь святого Георгия в Улумбо был основан святым Михаилом Улумбо, который приложил большие усилия для распространения христианства в горах Верхней Картли и Осетии. Он основал большой монастырь недалеко от деревни Улумбо. Церковь этого монастыря, которая в 19 веке стала приходской церковью Успения Пресвятой Богородицы у деревни Гоми, хранит его святые мощи. (Поездка туда предпринимается только по желанию группы, так как дорога туда составляет 150 км).
Возвращение в отель. Ночь в отеле в Тбилиси.

День 6 – Тур по монастырям святых ассирийских отцов
Завтрак в отеле. Мы покидаем отель, взяв с собой некоторые личные вещи первой необходимости. Это один из самых красивых регионов Грузии, известный не только достопримечательностями, но и Алазанской долиной с ее вином и дружелюбным населением.

Марткопский монастырь - легендарное место, вдали от проторенных дорог. Он знаменит могилой святого Антония Марткопского и Башней святого Антония. Раньше это была большая деревня, о чем свидетельствуют многочисленные артефакты, найденные при раскопках. Название Марткопи можно перевести как анахорет или отшельник. Святой Антоний прожил 15 лет в одиночестве в башне. Монастырь был известен иконой Спасителя, которая исчезла после набегов Тамерлана.
Давид-Гареджа - Монастырский ансамбль включает 20 монастырей, главным из которых является лавра святого Давида. Энергию этого монастыря чувствуешь повсюду. Эти святые места выдержали много вторжений, но преодолели все превратности веков, играя ведущую роль в духовном развитии Грузии.
Хирский монастырь был основан в 6-м веке святым Стефаном Хирским, одним из 13 ассирийских отцов. Это место упокоения этого святого человека.
Ночь в отеле или гостевом доме в Кахетии.

День 7 - Тур по монастырям святых ассирийских отцов
Завтрак в отеле. Сегодня мы продолжим наше путешествие по Кахетии и посетим самые интересные монастыри, спрятанные в глуши.
Монастырь Некреси. Сегодня это просто монастырь, но раньше вокруг его стен был большой город. Монастырь расположен на высокой скале, с которой открывается великолепный вид на Алазанскую долину. Первое строение здесь датируется 4-м веком, что указывает на то, что оно было построено в дополнение к действующей церкви.
Монастырь Икалто содержал академию, где учился Шота Руставели. Эта академия была построена в 12 веке царем Давидом Строителем и долгое время после этого функционировала как один из значительных культурных центров Грузии.
Монастырь Алаверди является одним из четырех главных соборов этой страны. Хотя происхождение его названия неясно, его история интересна. Монастырь представляет интерес с разных точек зрения: он важен для истории грузинской архитектуры, для истории грузинского православия и для духовной жизни Северной Кахетии, для которой он является главным собором и резиденцией епископа. В монастыре действует строгий кодекс поведения.

const threeGorgesDescription_ru = `День 1 - Ущелье Атени – Уплисцихе – пещерный город с трехтысячелетней историей

ПРОГРАММА ДНЯ

• Уплисцихе - пещерный город
• Атенский Сиони
• Село Бииси и водопад Бииси
• Виноделие.

Уплисцихе занимает особое место среди исторических достопримечательностей Грузии. Его уникальность заключается в том, что этот город, которому три тысячи лет, высечен в твердой скале. Большую часть времени это был населенный город, но в 19 веке жители покинули его. Теперь эти пещеры включены в список всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО.
Атенский Сиони - это церковь в селе Атени к югу от Гори на левом берегу реки Тана. Она была построена в 7 веке, немного позже знаменитого монастыря Джвари (около 630 года), до арабского вторжения. Помимо прекрасных фресок, в ней много надписей как внутри, так и снаружи церкви. Благодаря этим надписям и их историческому значению, Атенский Сиони по праву считается безусловным лидером среди всех церквей в Грузии.
Село и водопад Бииси. – Еще километр по ущелью, и между дорогой и рекой находятся руины бывшей бани с серной водой, и при желании можно в ней искупаться. Примерно в 300 метрах к югу за Бииси есть небольшая долина, через которую проходит тропа к водопаду Бииси, который является местом назначения многих людей. Главным ориентиром начала тропы является деревянный мост через реку Тана. Затем мы следуем по узкому ущелью реки Тхинала, которое довольно живописно. Мы должны идти строго вдоль реки, не сворачивая вверх, где есть грунтовая дорога, ведущая в село Церети. Подъемов и спусков нет, пока мы идем мимо неопознанных руин, пока, наконец, не достигнем водопада Бииси. Он небольшой, но довольно красивый и с привлекательной поляной рядом.

Виноделие. Ущелье Атени - единственное место в Шида Картли, где выращивают хорошие сорта винограда, из которых получаются вина превосходного качества.
Это своего рода климатическая микрозона, потому что трудно сказать, почему виноград здесь растет очень хорошо, а в соседних ущельях плохо. Виноделы говорят, что это объясняется особенностями местного песка. Виноград выращивают в основном в нижней северной части ущелья, вблизи сел Хидистави и Атени. Сельскохозяйственных угодий здесь довольно мало, и с недавних пор люди начали делать террасы на склонах. Именно из ущелья Атени вино марки «Мцване» поставлялось к столу Сталина на его дачах. Этот «сталинский» виноград выращивают на склоне возле Атенской крепости.

День 2 – Ущелье Дзама

ПРОГРАММА ДНЯ
• Монастырь Кинцвиси
• Крепость-монастырь Мдзоврети
• Озеро Батети

Ущелье Дзама - одно из самых своеобразных мест в Грузии, сочетающее в себе как исторические, так и религиозные памятники. Это удивительное место, где вы путешествуете в прошлое, чтобы узнать историю Грузии и увидеть ее природу и экологию. Долина Дзама - это скопление около 60 исторических памятников, старых и новых церквей и монастырей, крепостей, оборонительных башен и прекрасной природы. Она расположена примерно в 130-140 км от Тбилиси, в муниципалитете Карели. Это ущелье несравненной красоты, полное монастырей и церквей. Вы чувствуете себя погруженным в возвышенную духовную атмосферу и ощущаете благодать. Люди говорят: «Здесь, в каждой церкви или монастыре, если вы прошепчете молитву, Господь Бог услышит ее гораздо скорее, чем если вы молитесь где-либо еще». Покинув ущелье, вы становитесь уверенными, что можете сделать свою жизнь лучше и приятнее для души. Епископ Иов называет это место «республикой монахов». После посещения этих святых мест вы наполнитесь благодатью и добротой. Есть случаи воссоединения распавшихся семей, многие люди приняли христианство и укрепили свою веру. Многие преодолели неизлечимые болезни, молясь здесь, потому что монастыри и церкви здесь отмечены благодатью. Священник часто говорит, что ущелье Дзама - это опора Грузии.
Монастырь Кинцвиси, расположенный в Карельском районе, Шида Картли, является монастырем, посвященным святому Николаю Мирликийскому, и включает в себя несколько церквей, построенных в разные эпохи. Главная из них - церковь святого Николая Мирликийского, построенная в начале 13 века во время правления царицы Тамары. Другими словами, это означает, что эта церковь относится к Золотому веку грузинской истории и архитектуры и связана с личностью царицы. Она отличается от монастырей других периодов тем, что спрятана глубоко в ущелье Дзама, вдали от проторенных дорог. Известно, что монастырь был построен в основном около 1200 года, хотя небольшая церковь святой Марии датируется 10 веком. Церковь святого Николая – главный храм ансамбля – была возведена при жизни царицы Тамары. Сохранились некоторые фрески того периода. До нас дошло очень мало таких фресок, что и объясняет славу этого монастыря.
Крепость-монастырь Мдзоврети, также известная как Мдзоврети или Дзамская крепость, - это укрепление высоко на горе, возвышающейся над деревней Ортубани в ущелье Дзами (Карельский район). Раньше это был старый замок, а после 2010 года на его руинах был возведен монастырь. Сейчас строительные работы завершены, и монастырь приобрел известность. В настоящее время этот современный монастырь Мдзоврети расположен высоко на высокой горе в ущелье Дзами. Эта гора, по-видимому, была заселена в очень ранние эпохи. Ходят слухи, что археологи обнаружили следы человеческого жилья, датируемые 1-м веком. Дальнейшая история этой горы несколько туманна. В какой-то момент здесь была построена Дзамская крепость, которая в 14 веке принадлежала князьям Торели. В 14 веке ущелье было пожаловано человеку по имени Заза Цицишвили-Панаскеретели, который решил не жить там, а остался в замке Самцевиси, который он построил для себя. Позже, предположительно в начале 17 века, он переехал в замок Мдзоврети рядом с одноименным городом.
Озеро Батети - небольшое озеро, спрятанное в Дзамской крепости, заросшей лесом, на юге Карельского района на высоте 1250 или 1300 метров над уровнем моря. Три километра ухабистой грунтовой дороги, полной ям, подъемов и спусков, и вы снова на нормальном асфальте. Люди приезжают сюда, чтобы насладиться прохладным воздухом, пропитанным ароматом ели, и сделать хорошие фотографии осеннего леса. Озеро расположено в ущелье реки Батетисцкали, которая ответвляется от ущелья Дзама. Батетисцкали - небольшая река, вытекающая из соседних гор, питающая озеро и впадающая в реку Дзами. Озеро образовалось очень давно, когда оползень перекрыл сток воды. Точная высота озера - 1313 метров над уровнем моря.

День 3 - Ущелье Тедзами

ПРОГРАММА ДНЯ
• Монастырь Эртцминда
• Церковь Икви
• Ркони
• Мост царицы Тамары
• Артсвилл Гарикула

Здесь мы расскажем вам о достопримечательностях, неизвестных за пределами Грузии. Они скрываются от любопытных глаз иностранных гостей, которые здесь редки, но это не умаляет значения этого района. Святые места в ущелье Тедзами являются объектами так называемого внутреннего туризма. Поездка туда обогатит ваши знания и приблизит вас к грузинской культуре. Она начинается от деревни Ркони, от моста через реку Тедзами. Здесь есть рекламный щит, указывающий маршруты от деревни Ркони до одноименного монастырского ансамбля, моста царицы Тамары, крепости Клдекари и других мест. Как только вы пересечете мост, вы окажетесь в начале извилистой и хорошо протоптанной дороги к монастырю. Следуя по ущелью реки Тедзами, вы подниметесь на возвышенность, и оттуда откроется чудесный вид на Рконский лес. Пройдя через него, вы приблизитесь к монастырю Ркони, где много мест, подходящих для установки палаток и организации кемпинга. Наша компания предлагает захватывающий тур в Шида Картли, ущелье Тедзами и другие места. Мы уверены, что грузинские пейзажи станут незабываемым открытием для тех, кто любит треккинг. Мы предлагаем различные маршруты из одного региона в другой, через заповедники, самобытные деревни и тому подобное. Ваше лучшее приключение ждет вас.
Монастырский ансамбль Ркони Этот ансамбль состоит из церкви Девы Марии, часовни, трапезной, башни, колокольни и церкви святого Иоанна Крестителя с воротами к ней. Удивительно, но этот ансамбль строился долгое время: с 7-го века, когда была возведена церковь Девы Марии, до 13-14 веков, когда появилась колокольня.
Мост царицы Тамары был построен в 12-13 веках, в период, когда здесь проходил важный торговый путь. Он считается одним из лучших мостов того времени. Сейчас этот мост полностью восстановлен и приобрел свой первоначальный вид.
Артсвилл Гарикула Какое самое богемное место в Грузии? Этот вопрос следует задать местным жителям Каспского района после того, как вы покинете Тбилиси и проедете через Мцхету. Обычная узкая деревенская дорога разветвляется так много раз, что можно запутаться, куда идти среди множества домов с садами. Убедившись, что люди, живущие здесь, дружелюбны и привыкли к вопросам, вы увидите забор, покрытый психоделическими граффити, и в конце пути вы прибудете к дому с башней с флюгером на вершине и открытыми воротами. Это Гарикула – рай для грузинских художников.

Откройте глаза шире, чтобы увидеть серовато-голубые горы на горизонте, виноградники на их склонах, небольшой бассейн с молчаливыми скульптурами вокруг и множество различных произведений искусства, разбросанных по всей территории Артсвилла.
Откройте уши, потому что здесь тишина наполнена звуками, которые значат гораздо больше, чем слова. Это настоящий рай, куда посторонним вход воспрещен.
Это, кстати, подтверждается надписью на потолке площадки крутой деревянной лестницы.

const threeMiraclesDescription_ru = `Маршрут: Тбилиси – Кахетия – Гори
Продолжительность тура: 3 дня

Тур в Грузию на три дня - это лучший вариант короткой, но насыщенной программы отдыха от повседневных забот. Красивые места и свежий воздух определенно помогут вам зарядиться новой энергией для тела и ума.

Общая информация:

День 1: Обзорная экскурсия по Тбилиси
Ваш гид поднимет вам настроение, уводя от утомительных повседневных дел, и проведет вас по древнему и гостеприимному Тбилиси. Мы пройдемся по старинным районам города с их уютными двориками и подземными переходами. Вас угостят органическим вином и хлебом, испеченным в древней печи прямо на ваших глазах.
Мы расскажем вам, как Тбилиси стал столицей Грузии и почему его сравнивают с птицей из сказки. Вы полюбуетесь балконами в ажурных деревянных рамах, караван-сараями в оригинальных архитектурных стилях, аскетичными церквями и куполами древних бань, богатыми домами местной буржуазии 19-го века и современными фасадами модернистских строений. Тбилиси невероятно эклектичен, что бросается в глаза, когда видишь такие почти футуристические объекты, как Стеклянный мост или кукольный театр, не говоря уже о том, что ждет вашего внимания на улице Шардени и как это сопоставляется с ущельем Инжира и крепостью Нарикала.

ПРОГРАММА ДНЯ
Она охватывает площадь Свободы, площадь Гудиашвили, проспект Бараташвили, церковь Анчисхати (одна из первых церквей в Тбилиси), мост Мира, парк Рике, канатную дорогу, которая доставляет пассажиров на крепость Нарикала, статую «Мать-Грузия», древний район Абанотубани, улицу Сиони, памятник тамаде, караван-сарай и многие другие места.

Площадь Свободы. Мы услышим о ее преобразованиях на протяжении веков и проследим, как менялся ее облик и функции со временем, и какую роль она играет в жизни сегодняшнего Тбилиси. Затем мы исследуем места, известные только местным жителям. Вы увидите интересное место с подземными переходами и двориком, где были обнаружены средневековые артефакты. Вход туда ограничен. Теперь о традиционном хлебе. Мы посетим место, где находится самая старая печь, датируемая 17-м веком, для выпечки «шоти» - национального сорта хлеба, и неподалеку у вас будет возможность не только посмотреть, как пекут хлеб, но и поучаствовать в процессе. Затем мы перейдем к дегустации изысканных сортов вина из лучших виноградников и услышим много интересной информации о виноделии. Мы будем рады ответить на ваши вопросы о Тбилиси и стране в целом. По пути от одной остановки к другой вы будете наслаждаться атмосферой гостеприимства, расслабления и уюта. В конце тура мы можем организовать фотосессию в грузинских национальных костюмах.

Пешеходная экскурсия к историческому центру Тбилиси

• Кукольный театр Резо Габриадзе. Это башня сложной конструкции с часами, которые каждый час показывают кукольное представление.
• Мост Мира через реку Мтквари – причудливое зрелище.
• Парк Рике с фуникулером, поднимающимся к крепости Нарикала, чьи древние стены хранят воспоминания о старых временах и легендах.
• Мы спускаемся к серным баням. Это настоящий оздоровительный центр Тбилиси. Там также есть каньон необычной формы с водопадом.
• Улица Шардени. Это Мекка светской жизни и развлечений.
• Памятник тамаде: мы услышим его историю и загадаем желание.
• Сионский собор, где хранится крест святой Нино, защищающий нашу страну.

День 2

Гомборский перевал примечателен своим красивым пейзажем. Это 65-километровая дорога, проходящая через лес Гомборского хребта, который также является водоразделом между долинами рек Алазани и Иори. Перевал находится на нижних склонах хребта, а его самая высокая точка находится на высоте 1620 метров над уровнем моря.
Крепость Уджарма. Благодаря своему расположению и исторической важности, эта крепость является одним из самых важных памятников грузинской средневековой архитектуры. Начиная с 3-го века н.э., она была резиденцией грузинских царей и их наследников. Она достигла расцвета в 5-6 веках во время правления Вахтанга Горгасали и его сына Дачи. В этот период здесь была возведена цитадель с высокими стенами, сторожевыми и оборонительными башнями, а также резиденция и церковь.
Старая и новая Шуамта - это грузинский архитектурный ансамбль в лесу Телавского района, примерно в 7 километрах от города Телави. Ансамбль состоит из двух частей – Дзвели (старая) Шуамта и Ахали (новая) Шуамта, и его название происходит от его расположения между тремя горами, которые его окружают.
Город Телави (родина Валико из фильма «Мимино») Телави известен с 1-го века н.э. как значительный торговый центр на караванном пути с Ближнего Востока в Европу. В 11-м веке и с 17-го по 18-й века он был столицей Кахетии.
Винодельня «Шуми» - Компания «Шуми», основанная в 1997 году, предлагает уникальное «погружение» в 8-тысячелетнюю традицию виноделия в Кахетии, Грузия. «Шуми» производит различные марки вина и винных продуктов из винограда, используя уникальные технологии. Девиз компании - качество и инновации. Это была первая компания, которая использовала биодинамические и экологически чистые методы сбора винограда и производства органических вин, которые завоевали 270 международных призов и экспортируются в 27 стран мира.
На винодельне есть:
• Коллекция из более чем 900 различных сортов виноградных лоз
• Первый грузинский музей вин (некоторым экспонатам более 6000 лет)
• Грузинский этнографический павильон

День 3

Уплисцихе-Атени Сиони-Гори

ПРОГРАММА ДНЯ
• Уплисцихе
• Атени Сиони
• Гори (Дом-музей И.В. Сталина)

Уплисцихе. Он занимает особое место среди достопримечательностей Грузии. Его уникальность в том, что этот пещерный город с трехтысячелетней историей был покинут жителями в 19 веке. Сейчас пещеры Уплисцихе находятся в списке всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО.
Атени Сиони - это церковь в деревне Атени, расположенная к югу от Гори на левом берегу реки Тана. Она была построена немного позже знаменитого Джвари, в начале 7-го века (около 630 года) до арабского вторжения. Внутри много фресок и надписей как внутри, так и снаружи храма. Благодаря этим фрескам и надписям, дошедшим до нас из Золотого века (примерно с 1080 года), их количеству и исторической ценности, Атени Сиони занимает лидирующее положение среди всех церквей Грузии.
Дом-музей И.В. Сталина. Самый заметный в самом сердце города, среди старых зданий, возвышается этот величественный дворец в оригинальном готическом стиле. Это дом-музей И.В. Сталина, построенный здесь в 1950-х годах. Он стоит рядом с небольшим домом, где 21 декабря 1879 года великий «кремлевский горец» родился в семье сапожника Виссариона Джугашвили.

const holyVirginGraceDescription_ru = `Православный паломнический тур «Благодать Пресвятой Богородицы» длится 10 дней / 9 ночей.
Этот тур открывает вам возможность посетить главные святыни Грузии. В отличие от любой другой поездки, он поднимет ваше настроение и душу, ведь вы посетите не только монастыри и церкви Грузии, но и узнаете больше о городах, курортах и истории грузинского народа, чей героизм во времена войн сумел укрепить веру в Иисуса Христа, благодаря чему страна сохранила свое христианство. Неслучайно Грузия стала уделом Пресвятой Богородицы, где христианство распространяли святые апостолы Андрей Первозванный и Симон Кананит.

Направления, которые предлагает тур по Грузии за 10 дней:
Тбилиси – Мцхета – Гареджи – Бодбе – Ананури – Гергети – Боржоми – Кутаиси – Батуми.

День 1 – Встреча в аэропорту Тбилиси
Трансфер в отель.
Свободное время

День 2 – Экскурсия по Тбилиси и поездка в Мцхету
Завтрак в отеле.
Пешеходная экскурсия по Тбилиси начнется с Собора Святой Троицы – одного из древнейших христианских храмов не только в Тбилиси, но и во всей Грузии. Немногие знают, что треть святынь хранится здесь под землей, где сегодня стоит этот шедевр церковной архитектуры. Три из них, открытые для обозрения, – это Икона чаяний Грузии, Крест, который святая Нино воздвигла в Мцхете, и Камень благодати Давида Гареджийского.
Церковь Рождества Пресвятой Богородицы в Метехи – это место, где в 8-м веке был замучен святой Або Тбилисский. Здесь хранятся мощи святой Шушаник, царицы Рани, замученной до смерти своим мужем-отступником. При жизни она была благословлена даром чудотворения. И сегодня верующие приходят молиться к месту ее захоронения. Теперь перейдем реку Мтквари по мосту Метехи, посвященному 100 000 мученикам.
Сионский собор известен не только своим уникальным архитектурным стилем, но и хранящимися в нем религиозными реликвиями – древним крестом святой Нино, главой апостола Фомы, благоухающей иконой апостола Андрея Первозванного. История Сионского собора неразрывно связана с историей Тбилиси и является уникальным историческим и культурным памятником этой страны. Сионский собор, посвященный Успению Пресвятой Богородицы, является центром православия.
Далее мы посетим церковь Анчисхати, где хранилась знаменитая икона Анчийского Спаса. Изначально церковь была посвящена Рождеству Богородицы, но в 1675 году ей было дано другое название – церковь Анчисхати из-за переноса сюда Анчийской иконы из Тао-Кларджети. Эта церковь является самым высоким зданием в Тбилиси. Только представьте, сколько раз она была свидетелем разрушения и возрождения Тбилиси на протяжении веков от разорений войны, пока не приняла тот вид, в котором мы ее видим сегодня.
Церковь святого Давида, также известная как Мамадавити, – еще одна достопримечательность. Она была построена на территории сегодняшнего Пантеона на горе Мтацминда, на средней станции фуникулера. В 10-м веке Давид Гареджийский построил здесь небольшую часовню, где из-под скалы бьют три чудотворных источника, известные как «слезы Давида». Давид Гареджийский был одним из 13 монахов-миссионеров, распространявших христианство в Грузии, и верующие считают это место святым.
Далее мы отправимся в Мцхету – святой город для всех грузин, которые тысячами приезжают сюда, чтобы помолиться у самого почитаемого собора Светицховели, где хранятся величайшие святыни Грузинской православной церкви – хитон Господень и плащ пророка Илии.
Это еще не конец нашего паломнического тура. Мы также посетим женский монастырь Самтавро, где похоронены первые христианские грузинские правители царь Мириан III и его царица Нана. Здесь также находится могила святого Гавриила, почитаемого старца, канонизированного Грузинской церковью. К ней можно прикоснуться, потому что святой обладал даром пророчества и целительства. Множество паломников из разных стран посещали его каждый день, как и сегодня. Затем мы посетим монастырь Джвари, где равноапостольная святая Нино воздвигла крест.

Возвращение в отель. Ночь в Тбилиси.

День 3 – Тур в Давид-Гареджи, Сигнахи и Бодбе
Завтрак в отеле.
Посещение одного из самых почитаемых монастырских архитектурных ансамблей, основанного в 6-м веке святым Давидом Гареджийским. Затем мы отправимся в Сигнахи - прелестный сказочный городок, расположенный в Алазанской долине и окруженный Кавказскими горами. Сотни паломников приезжают сюда, чтобы преклонить колени и помолиться у могилы святой Нино.
Давид-Гареджи - это монастырский архитектурный ансамбль из 20 монастырей, главным из которых является лавра святого Давида. Ансамбль, кажется, заряжен какой-то энергией, которую чувствуешь повсюду. Этот ансамбль выдержал разрушения времени и войн и играет значительную роль в духовном развитии Грузии.
Монастырь Бодбе - православный монастырь, где похоронена святая Нино. Этот монастырь с гордостью считается одним из первых религиозных объектов древней Грузии. Здесь хранится Иверская икона Божьей Матери, которая была повреждена вандалом хирургическим скальпелем в советский период. Грузинские цари защищали и поддерживали этот монастырь, который был значительным центром образования народа.
Источник святой Нино - место, где верующие преклоняют колени перед спуском к чудотворному источнику целебной воды святой Нино.

Возвращение в Тбилиси. Ночь в отеле.

День 4 – Тур по Военно-Грузинской дороге
Завтрак в отеле.
Замок Ананури был главной крепостью воинственных грузинских эриставов или феодальных князей. В его стенах сохранились две церкви 17-го века. Исторически интересна церковь Успения Пресвятой Богородицы, потому что с 17-го века турки активно распространяли ислам и уничтожали все памятники христианства. Другая интересная церковь в Ананури - это церковь Пресвятой Богородицы, также известная как церковь Спасения, построенная в 1674 году по приказу Анны-ханум Абашидзе в память о ее муже и сыне.
Неизвестно, кем были эти двое мужчин, но в 2018 году она была закрыта для посетителей.
Жинвальское водохранилище по праву считается одним из самых красивых мест в Грузии. Помимо религиозных центров, мы совершим поездку по Военно-Грузинской дороге с прекрасными видами. Мы также увидим арку дружбы между народами России и Грузии и Дарьяльское ущелье.
Церковь Святой Троицы, построенная в 14-м веке, стоит на высоте 2170 метров над уровнем моря. Это одно из самых интересных святых мест Грузии. Церковь часто закрывалась во времена вражеских набегов. Находясь вдали от проторенных дорог, она была выбрана как место, куда приносили для сокрытия святыни Грузии. Тем не менее, несмотря на то, что до церкви было трудно добраться, ее охраняли мужчины из близлежащих хевсурских деревень, которые были освобождены от призыва в армию во время войны. Есть монастырь Вифлеем, который находится еще выше, но он закрыт для посетителей. Тем не менее, с этим монастырем связаны интересные истории, которые долгое время считались вымыслом.

Возвращение в отель. Ночь в отеле в Тбилиси.

День 5 – Посещение женского монастыря Пока, пещерного города Вардзиа и Рабата
Завтрак в отеле.
Сегодня мы покидаем Тбилиси и отправляемся на запад, чтобы увидеть самые красивые христианские святыни Грузии. Наше паломничество начнется с озера Паравани, самого большого в Грузии. Несмотря на то, что это озеро расположено высоко в горах, его максимальная глубина составляет всего 3 метра. Эта жемчужина Грузии окружена альпийскими лугами.
Женский монастырь Пока - первое место, где святая Нино остановилась на отдых на своем пути из Армении в Грузию. Именно здесь она встретила пастухов, которые показали ей дорогу в Мцхету. Этот монастырь действует и сегодня и славится своим сыром и шоколадом, изготовленными монахинями.
Вардзиа - пещерный город, считающийся одной из самых замечательных достопримечательностей Грузии. Нельзя не восхищаться масштабом этого чуда и мастерством рабочих, высекших его в скале.
Это был скрытый от глаз город, который давал приют монахам и местным жителям, пока землетрясение не ударило по нему и не разрушило некоторые строения. Помимо келий и проходов в скале, восхищение вызывает церковь Успения Пресвятой Богородицы, высеченная в твердой скале, как вершина церковного искусства.
Крепость Рабат - старинное каменное укрепление, являющееся культурной частью города Ахалцихе. Это город в городе с башнями, церквями, кельями и мечетью, дошедшими до нас.

Ночь в гостевом доме в Ахалцихе.

День 6 – Монастырь Тимотесубани и Кацхийский столп
Завтрак в отеле. Сегодня мы двинемся в сторону Кутаиси. Нашей первой остановкой будет монастырь Читахеви, посвященный святому Георгию, который здесь широко известен как Зеленый монастырь. Затем мы переедем к церкви Тимотесубани и ее монастырскому ансамблю Успения Пресвятой Богородицы, датируемому 12-13 веками.
Церковь Успения Пресвятой Богородицы в Тимотесубани является выдающимся памятником культурного наследия Грузии.
Кацхийский столп – или монастырь, посвященный Вознесению Господню, расположен вдали от туристических маршрутов. Этот монастырь является местом назначения многочисленных паломников. Построенный между 6-м и 8-м веками, он возвышается на 40 метров над уровнем земли. Подниматься в монастырь разрешено только мужчинам с разрешения монаха Максима. Женщинам вход воспрещен.

Возвращение в отель. Ночь в Кутаиси.

День 7 – Экскурсия по Кутаиси
Завтрак в отеле. Обзорная экскурсия по Кутаиси.
Гелатский монастырь Пресвятой Богородицы - один из главных монастырских ансамблей в Имеретии, возведенный царем Давидом Строителем.
Собор Баграти или просто Баграт в речи местных жителей, является излюбленным местом отдыха для местных жителей, независимо от того, сколько других названий ему приписывают.
Монастырь Моцамета, заросший лесом, расположен в начале каньона и считается самым красивым монастырем в Имеретии. В нем хранятся мощи святых Давида и Константина. Они были братьями и были казнены за отказ принять ислам.

Переезд в Батуми. Размещение в отеле.

День 8 – Экскурсия по Батуми.
Завтрак в отеле.
Пешеходная экскурсия по Батуми для осмотра святынь.
Собор Рождества Пресвятой Богородицы - главный собор в Батуми, построенный в римско-католическом стиле. Своеобразная архитектура собора привлекает не только религиозных паломников, но и туристов, которые любят осматривать своеобразные достопримечательности и здания необычного дизайна.
Церковь святого Николая и Пьяцца расположены в самом сердце исторической части Батуми. Собор был построен на средства, пожертвованные местным населением, и с разрешения турецкого султана. Золотые купола церкви добавляют красоты городу и радуют христиан. Напротив церкви находится Пьяцца. С архитектурной точки зрения, это интересная площадь, где можно выпить чашечку вкусного кофе и сделать красивые фотографии. Пьяццу часто описывают как маленькую Италию с многочисленными картинами и мозаиками. Она часто служит центром для различных мероприятий, официальных приемов и концертов.
Церковь святой Варвары не так популярна, как другие церкви Батуми, хотя ее история очень интересна. Она была построена по личному приказу императора Александра III как часть военного госпиталя. В середине прошлого века она была закрыта, и только Сталин открыл ее и вернул Батуми в 1946 году. Это приятное и тихое место почти без посетителей, и атмосфера здесь расслабляющая и умиротворяющая.
Помимо религиозных достопримечательностей, мы также увидим местный бульвар, Парк Чудес, где есть колесо обозрения и статуи Али и Нино, парк 9 мая и многое другое.

После экскурсии вы можете вернуться в отель самостоятельно.

Подробности тура:
Дворец Дадиани - изысканная фамильная резиденция мегрельских князей Дадиани. Это настоящее украшение города, свидетельствующее о его былом значении. Дадиани - аристократическая семья, известная, в частности, своими родственными связями с Наполеоном Бонапартом. Одна из княгинь рода Дадиани была замужем за племянником Наполеона Ахиллом Мюратом, после чего многие личные вещи и предметы мебели Наполеона, а также одна из посмертных масок императора перешли к Дадиани (две другие маски находятся в Англии и Франции). Все это хранилось в семейном музее Дадиани. Среди прочего, там также находится плащаница Пресвятой Богородицы. Легенда гласит, что эта плащаница была привезена в Грузию из Византии одним из предков князей Дадиани в 15 веке. Эту плащаницу можно увидеть только по большим церковным праздникам.
Поместье князей Дадиани также известно своим чудесным садом, основанным княгиней Дадиани, урожденной Чавчавадзе, сестрой Нино Чавчавадзе, вдовы русского писателя Александра Грибоедова. В середине 19 века княгиня Екатерина пригласила известных садоводов и закупила редкие растения из Европы, и так появился сад. Сегодня это Зугдидский ботанический сад, занимающий площадь 26,4 гектара. Некоторым деревьям здесь около 200 лет, и они считаются единственными экземплярами на европейском континенте.
Анаклия - новейший курорт на Черном море в Грузии. Основанный только в 2011 году, сегодня курорт Анаклия привлекает тысячи туристов и молодежь со всех уголков мира. Несмотря на то, что он расположен довольно близко к Кобулети и Батуми, климат в Анаклии существенно отличается от других черноморских курортов. Он субтропический, но более сухой и с меньшим количеством осадков. Средняя летняя температура составляет 23-25 градусов по Цельсию. Благодаря постоянному бризу здесь никогда не бывает душно, потому что жара сдувается днем, а ночи приятные и свежие.
В отличие от Кобулети и Батуми, пляжи здесь из чистого песка, с шезлонгами, большими зонтами и душевыми. Пляж здесь простирается на 8 километров вдоль кромки воды. Море здесь чистое благодаря большому расстоянию от больших городов и неглубокое, что является отличным условием для купания детей.

Крепость Уджарма
Уджарма является одним из самых значительных средневековых архитектурных памятников Грузии, известным как своим стратегическим расположением, так и исторической важностью. Датируемая 3 веком нашей эры, крепость служила королевской резиденцией для царей и их наследников. Уджарма процветала в 5-6 веках, особенно во времена правления царя Вахтанга Горгасали и его сына Дачи. В то время была построена цитадель с высокими стенами, оборонительными и смотровыми башнями, королевской резиденцией и церковью.

Мы расскажем вам, как Грузия обрела свою столицу и что делает Тбилиси похожим на птицу из сказки. Вы увидите балконы с резными обрамлениями, оригинальную архитектуру караван-сараев, аскетичные церкви и купола древних бань, солидные дома состоятельных людей, сохранившиеся с 19 века, и причудливые фасады зданий в стиле модернизма. Тбилиси невероятно эклектичен по своему облику, что особенно заметно в новых, почти футуристических зданиях – Стеклянном мосте и кукольном театре, которые вы увидите вместе с улицей Шардени, ущельем Инжира и крепостью Нарикала.
Программа дня
Наша программа включает посещение площади Свободы, сада Гудиашвили, проспекта Бараташвили, церкви Анчисхати (одной из первых в Тбилиси), Моста Мира, парка Рике, фуникулера, крепости Нарикала, статуи Матери-Грузии, исторического района Абанотубани с древними банями, памятника тамаде, караван-сарая и множества других вещей.
Площадь Свободы. Мы начнем с этой исторической площади. Вы услышите о ее преобразованиях на протяжении веков, о том, как менялся ее облик и функции со временем, и о роли, которую город играет в повседневной жизни в настоящее время. Затем мы отправимся в места, известные только местным жителям. Вы окажетесь в интересном районе с подземными переходами, двориком, где были обнаружены древние артефакты, который открыт не для всех. Затем мы сделаем остановку в древней пекарне, где национальный хлеб, известный как «шоти», до сих пор регулярно выпекается с 17 века. Недалеко отсюда у вас будет возможность не только понаблюдать за процессом выпечки, но и поучаствовать в нем. Виноградное вино – самый любимый напиток грузин, которые иногда называют его священным. Мы продолжим нашу экскурсию дегустацией изысканных вин из лучших виноградников страны и встретимся с их производителями. На протяжении всей экскурсии вы обязательно откроете для себя новые свойства этого благородного напитка и узнаете много нового о виноделии.
В течение всей экскурсии вы будете наслаждаться атмосферой гостеприимства, расслабления и уюта. Перемещаясь от одного места к другому, мы будем рады ответить на ваши вопросы о городе и стране в целом. Кроме того, в конце экскурсии мы можем организовать фотосессию в национальных костюмах.

Собор Светицховели. Мы посетим этот крупнейший исторический памятник церковной архитектуры, дошедший до нас. Мы расскажем вам о том, как был построен этот собор и как он стал христианским центром Грузии.
Монастырь Джвари или Монастырь Креста – это вершина развития грузинской архитектуры, и хотя он довольно мал по размеру, он поражает зрителя своим величием. Название этой церкви восходит к приказам святой Нино и царя Мириана установить крест на вершине этого холма.
Расположение этого монастыря заслуживает упоминания. С вершины холма, на котором он венчает, виден слияние рек Мтквари, текущей с юго-запада, и Арагви, текущей с северо-востока.
Женский монастырь Самтавро. В заключение вы посетите женский монастырь Самтавро – еще одну церковь начала 11 века и резиденцию епископа. Он расположен на склоне, и в нем похоронены первые христианские правители Грузии – царь Мириан III и его царица Нана.

День 4: Экскурсия в винодельческую Кахетию

Гомборский перевал примечателен своим красивым пейзажем. Это 65-километровая дорога, проходящая через лес Гомборского хребта, который также является водоразделом между долинами рек Алазани и Иори. Перевал находится на нижних склонах хребта, а его самая высокая точка находится на высоте 1620 метров над уровнем моря.
Крепость Уджарма. Благодаря своему расположению и исторической важности, эта крепость является одним из самых важных памятников грузинской средневековой архитектуры. Начиная с 3-го века н.э., она была резиденцией грузинских царей и их наследников. Она достигла расцвета в 5-6 веках, во время правления царя Вахтанга Горгасали и его сына Дачи. В этот период здесь была возведена цитадель с высокими стенами, сторожевыми и оборонительными башнями, а также резиденция и церковь.
Старая и новая Шуамта - это грузинский архитектурный ансамбль в лесу Телавского района, примерно в 7 километрах от города Телави. Ансамбль состоит из двух частей – Дзвели (старая) Шуамта и Ахали (новая) Шуамта, и его название происходит от его расположения между тремя горами, которые его окружают.
Телави известен с 1-го века н.э. как значительный торговый центр на караванном пути с Ближнего Востока в Европу. В 11-м веке и с 17-го по 18-й века он был столицей Кахетии.
Винодельня «Шуми» - Компания «Шуми», основанная в 1997 году, предлагает уникальное «погружение» в 8-тысячелетнюю традицию виноделия в Кахетии, Грузия. «Шуми» производит различные марки вина и винных продуктов из винограда, используя уникальные технологии. Девиз компании – «качество и инновации». Это была первая компания, которая использовала биодинамические и экологически чистые методы сбора винограда и производства органических вин, которые завоевали 270 международных призов и экспортируются в 27 стран мира.

День 5 – Ущелье Атени – Уплисцихе – пещерный город с трехтысячелетней историей

Ущелье реки Тана на юге Горийского района, которое начинается с вершин Триалетского хребта и заканчивается у города Гори, где Тана впадает в реку Мтквари. Ущелье длиной около 30-35 километров, густо населено, и по его дну проходит дорога. Оно знаменито церковью Атенский Сиони и особой климатической микрозоной, которая позволяет людям выращивать сорта винограда, подходящие для виноделия.

Уплисцихе - занимает особое место среди достопримечательностей Грузии. Его уникальная особенность - пещерный город, высеченный в скале. Удивительно, что на протяжении своей 3000-летней истории здесь жили люди и покинули его только в 19 веке. Сейчас пещеры Уплисцихе находятся под охраной ЮНЕСКО.

Сиони в Атени - это церковь в деревне Атени, расположенная к югу от Гори на левом берегу реки Тана. Она была построена немного позже знаменитого Джвари, в начале 7-го века (около 630 года), до арабского вторжения. Внутри много фресок Золотого века (т.е. примерно с 1080 года). Помимо фресок, в церкви много надписей как внутри, так и снаружи, историческое значение которых делает ее безусловным лидером среди церковных зданий в Грузии.
Деревня Бииси и ее водопад. Еще километр по ущелью приводит нас к началу деревни Бииси, где между дорогой и рекой находятся руины бывшей бани с серной водой. Здесь царит запустение, но при желании можно окунуться в настоящую серную воду. Примерно в 300 метрах за деревней на юг есть тропа, ведущая к водопаду Бииси, который привлекает много посетителей. Тропа начинается с деревянного моста через Тану. Затем идет узкое ущелье реки Тхинала. Нужно следовать этому ущелью, которое довольно живописно. Выше, справа, есть грунтовая дорога, ведущая к деревне Церети. Тропа идет без подъемов и спусков мимо неопознанных руин и приводит нас к водопаду. Он небольшой, но рядом есть красивая поляна.
Виноделие. Ущелье Атени - единственное место во всей Шида Картли, где выращивают превосходные сорта винограда, из которых делают прекрасные марки вина. Это своего рода климатическая микрозона, и трудно сказать, почему виноград здесь лучше, чем в соседних ущельях. Виноделы говорят, что это объясняется специфическими свойствами местного песка. Виноград в основном выращивают в нижней части ущелья, у деревень Хидистави и Атени. Сельскохозяйственных угодий здесь мало, поэтому в последние годы люди начали создавать террасы на склонах гор. Именно вино марки «Атенский Мцване» поставлялось к столу Сталина, а «сталинский» сорт винограда выращивали на склоне у Атенской крепости.

ПРОГРАММА ДНЯ
1. Уплисцихе – пещерный город
2. Атенский Сиони
3. Деревня и водопад Бииси
4. Виноделие.

День 6: свободный день в Тбилиси. Гала-ужин
